# ATAC Peak Annotation

You performed peak annotation yesterday for ChIPseq data using [ChIPseeker](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ChIPseeker/inst/doc/ChIPseeker.html).

> Can you repeat the same analysis using ATACseq peaks ?


## Extra challenge

Often you want to perform integrative analysis - ATACseq + ChIPseq or ATACseq + RNAseq etc. Let try a simple integration approach - 

Similar to how you plotted the ATACseq peak signal around transcription sytart site (TSS), can you plot the ATACseq peak signal around CTCF peaks, using the CTCF peak results that you have generated.
