## Technical pre-requisites

All the computation will be done on the cloud of the [German Bioinformatics Network de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/). All you need is a personal laptop to access the cloud server. 

Check the technical pre-requisites, depending on whether your operating system is Windows, MacOS or Linux

1. Generating ssh-keys and connecting to the server: instructions for all operating systems are [here](./ssh.md)
2. Installing Cyberduck to access remote files: instructions are [here](./cyberduck.md)
3. Installing RStudio: instructions are [here](./rstudio.md)
