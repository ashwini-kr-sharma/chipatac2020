# ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq Bioinformatics Analaysis Workshop

Welcome to the page of the workshop on the computational analysis of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analysis! This workshop is meant for people with little previous knowledge of bioinformatics.

## Tutors

* Carl Herrmann, [Health Data Science Unit](https://www.hdsu.org/) Medical Faculty Heidelberg and BioQuant (carl.herrmann@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de)
* Ashwini Sharma, [Health Data Science Unit](https://www.hdsu.org/) Medical Faculty Heidelberg and BioQuant (ashwini.sharma@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de)

## Program

The course will run over 2 days (Monday, 14.12 and Tuesday, 15.12) from 9am - 12.30am and 1.30pm - 5.30pm
