## Installing RStudio

RStudio is a very intuitive interface to work with the R environment. For some of the analysis steps, we will need to work with R to annotate peaks to the closest genes or make some plots.

Installing RStudio also requires that you install the R software; you can do this for all operating systems (windows/macOS/Linux)
