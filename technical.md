## Technical pre-requisite

In order to connect to the server, you will use two pieces of software:

* [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/): this is a software available for all operating systems allowing to browse files on a remote server; this will allow you to open files that you will be generating on the distant server (for example pdf files showing QC plots)
* **ssh-client**: the ssh-protocol allows you to securely connect to a distant server using a terminal; 

    1. if you are using MacOS or Linux, you have a native terminal environment. 
    2. If you are using Windows, you will need to install an additional piece of software
